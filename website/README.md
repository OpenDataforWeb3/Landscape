## SETUP

To setup hugo on your device I follow the instructions on the oficial website [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
or check out this video [here]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7umPCU-8xc)

You will want to create a folder for Hugo, save the executable to that directory and then set the path to that directory in the PATH variable in your system enviroment variables.

Once this is done you will be able to run the CLI Hugo commands on the repo (and any repo you want to use them on)

## CODE

Currently this projects code uses the m10c template.
To run locally hosted use the following command

<code>
    hugo server
</code>
